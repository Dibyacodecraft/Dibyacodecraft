 🧮  Scientific Calculator
A stylish, fully functional **Scientific Calculator GUI** built using Python's **Tkinter** library. This calculator supports basic arithmetic as well as advanced scientific operations, all wrapped in a modern, dark-themed interface.

 🚀 Features

* ✨ **Clean UI**: Sleek dark mode design with colorful button categorization.
* ➕ **Basic Math**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
* 📐 **Scientific Functions**:

  * Trigonometric: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
  * Logarithmic: `log` (base 10), `ln` (natural log)
  * Exponential: `e`, `x²`, `π`, `√`
  * Factorial: `n!`
* 🧠 **Smart Input Parsing**:

  * Allows nested expressions and operator chaining.
  * Safe `eval` execution with math module restrictions.
* 🔄 **Functional Buttons**:

  * Clear (`C`)
  * Backspace (`⌫`)
  * Parentheses (`()`)
  * Equals (`=`)

🛠️ Installation & Usage

 Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## 🧠 Internals

* Uses `tkinter` for GUI
* Mathematical expressions are processed using Python’s built-in `eval()` with restricted scope for safety.
* Handles scientific expressions by mapping symbols (`π`, `√`, `!`, etc.) to appropriate `math` functions.
